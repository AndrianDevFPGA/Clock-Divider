# Clock-Divider
Verilog program for clock divider

A clock divider is a circuit that takes an input signal of a frequency fin and generates an output signal of a frequency fout, where fout = fin / n and ''n'' is an integer. Frequency dividers are used for both analog and digital applications. Analog frequency dividers are used only at very high frequencies
